Inputs: 
1. User inputs day of birth,bDay
2. User inputs month of birth,bMonth
3. User inputs year of birth,bYear
4. Get current day,currentDay
5. Get current month,currentMonth
6. Get current year,currentYear
7. Get new user command, 'Y'or 'N'

Processing steps:
1. Ensure values for day of birth, month of birth, and year of birth are in the correct ranges
2. Subtract year of birth from current year
3. Compare month of birth and current month
4. Compare day of birth and current day. Determine age



Outputs:
1. Prompt user for the day of birth
2. Prompt user for the month of birth
3. Prompt user for the year of birth
4. Prompt user for new user command
5. Display "Your age is "+age
6. Print "Thanks for using the age calculator!"
